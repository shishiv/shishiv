Hey, I'm Myke 👋

I'm a full-stack dev from Minas Gerais, Brazil. I build software to solve real problems for small and mid-size businesses — the companies big tech overlooks.

I founded **[TrianguloTEC](https://triangulotec.com.br)**, a dev studio where we automate the boring stuff. Teams can focus on what matters. Our philosophy: tech should help people, not replace 'em.

Right now, I'm deep into AI-powered automation — chatbots, internal tools, and integrations that save hours on repetitive tasks. TrianguloTEC won 1st place at Fator S (SEBRAE), and I'm finishing my Information Systems degree at UEMG.

I'm fluent in TypeScript (the programming language and the spoken one — plus Portuguese and some Spanish).

#### What I'm building

**[RHBot](https://github.com/shishiv/rhbot)** — A WhatsApp HR assistant for Brazilian companies (100-500 employees). Workers ask things like "when's payday?" or "how many vacation days do I have?" and get instant answers instead of waiting 3 days. NestJS, Meta Cloud API, AI orchestration.

**[Gastei](https://github.com/shishiv/gastei)** — Personal finance tracker for couples. Text "gastei R$50 no mercado" on WhatsApp, and it logs automatically. Because nobody wants a spreadsheet at the grocery store.

**[Tijolar](https://github.com/shishiv/tijolar)** — Full website + admin panel for a construction materials store. Real client, real production. Next.js + Tailwind.

**[Coxixo](https://github.com/shishiv/coxixo)** — Voice-to-clipboard transcription for Windows. Hold a key, speak, release, paste. Built with C# and Azure Whisper 'cause I was tired of typing long messages.

**[Inclusao Digital UEMG](https://github.com/shishiv/inclusao-digital-uemg)** — An accessible web portal teaching adults 60+ how to use tech. It's a university research project that actually shipped and got used.

#### A bit more

- 🏆 1st place Fator S (SEBRAE) — startup competition at SCTI UEMG 2024
- 🎓 Information Systems @ UEMG Frutal (graduating 2028)
- 🔬 Former FAPEMIG research fellow
- 💼 Former Director of Information Systems @ Avance Consulting Jr.

I believe in "slow is fast" — taking time to build things right instead of rushing out broken code. I write code in English, think in Portuguese, and debug in whatever language the error message is in.

I'm looking for remote full-stack developer work. If you're building something cool with React, Next.js, TypeScript, or Node.js — let's talk.
