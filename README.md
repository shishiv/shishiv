### 🚀 About Me

I'm Myke — an Information Systems student from Brazil and a passionate web developer with a curious eye for **automation, system integration, and using technology to create social impact**.

My journey started with a deep desire to turn code into a tool for both personal and collective transformation. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into the JavaScript ecosystem — especially **React, Next.js, and Node.js** — and exploring tools that help me **build smart solutions fast**, such as **n8n, Node-RED, and Supabase**.

I take pride in having lead the technical team behind the full solution for **[Scapola Comunica](https://scapolacomunica.com)**. This project has taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, technical leadership, and delivering in real-world environments.

I also won the **Fator S Hackathon** (SEBRAE-MG), where my team created a solution focused on employability and recruitment automation — confirming my drive to build tech that solves meaningful problems.

I believe technology, when well applied, brings people closer, simplifies life, and creates new opportunities.  
I'm always learning — improving with every project, line of code, and collaboration.
